# Music-playlist-OCR-Python

This project is a work in progress.
Let's begin this with a story when i was in a great personal dilemma. I have been fan of Solo music app (ushowmedia.mipha) for quite long. 
And when they annouced the discontinuation of their services, i was left heartbroken. But i had a bigger problem to deal with. I have huge collection of favourite songs and multitudes of playlists that can't be exported or shared now.

*  There's only one thing that I can do now, export/scrape the data myself. But i am way too lazy to do it manually. So, it's time to automate some stuff !!
